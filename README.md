## General Information
### Problem Statement:
A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has a daily dataset on the rental bikes based on various environmental and seasonal settings. It wishes to use this data to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market and come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown due to corona pandemic comes to an end.
Essentially, the company wants to know â€”

- Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
- How well those variables describe the bike demands

## Conclusions
- A Linear Regression model with three significant variable has built to determine the demand for shared bikes. These three variables explain 68% of the variation in target variable.
